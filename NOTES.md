# NOTES

## TO DO

- router
  -- -/ (root) The initial step should have 3 fields: first name, email and password and a next button.-
  -- -/more-info The second step should have 2 fields: a favorite color select field and an agreement checkbox. A back button allows going back to the initial step and a next button to the confirmation screen.-
  -- -/confirmation: The third step is a read-only confirmation screen displaying the data collected in the 2 previous steps and a button to submit the form. A back button allows going back to to the previous step.-
  -- -/success: Final page to be shown if the form is successfully submitted. A restart button resets the data and returns to the initial step.-
  -- -/error An error page the user should be taken to if there are any server errors when submitting the form.-

- -save form info in the context-
- -Services:-
  -- -call color api-
  -- -submit api-
- -fix github ssh stuff-
- -loading-
- reset the store when starting over from sucess or error page
  - redirection if refresh

# Bonus

- Nice UI: bootstrap, mui & google material
  - Redirect the user to the first screen after refresh
- Terms and conditions overlay
- redirect to home after reload
- form
  -- validation
  -- components

# Specifications

- The list of colors to be displayed in the /more-info page should be built from the response to a GET request to http://localhost:3001/api/colors
- To submit the form data, use a POST request with an application/json content type to the http://localhost:3001/api/submit endpoint. The submitted data should look like:

```
{
    "name": "",
    "email": "",
    "password": "",
    "color": "",
    "terms": false
}
```

- Show the success / error page according to the HTTP status returned from the submit request.
- Add a loading indicator (spinner) to all API requests in order to provide UX feedback since the mocked server will have a delayed response

## Timesheet

- 11h-11h45 (45min): add react router, pages and formik
- 14h30-15:45 (1h15):
  -- add eslint, prettier and setup vscode to apply code formating on auto save. (I like clean code ðŸ¥°) but I had some issue for installing the latest eslint. CRA did not like that very much.
  -- start creating components
  -- having a snack
- 15:50-16:50 (1h):
  -- Create context to store the form data
- 19:30-19:45 (15min)
  -- fix issue related to context not keeping the state across pages
  -- update the sate on each step and display the content in Confirmation page.
  - 20:30-21:15 (45min)
    -- implement submit api logic (success vs error)
    -- add loading when interacting with APIs
    -- reset store when user restart the process from success or error page
    -- prefill the forms with the data in the store when user go back and forward the steps
